# titanic4kaggle

The aim of the porject is to learn how to use pycharm and Github and in the meanwhile review some of the main ML concepts \n
To do so I have decided to work with a simple yet effective database: The titanic dataset. 

The entire project is divided into 2 main folders, the first one in which we will find the data both in its raw form and in preprocessed one; in the latter, the Titanic analysis, we will find 3 different notebooks. 
In the first there is a preliminary exploratory analysis in which we will evaluate some general details about the variables both individually and sincroneausly; 
In the Feature engenieering there is the code to implement some variables that could come back as useful in the statistical analysis. The preprocessing has been perfomred both on the train and test data. 
In the Statistical analysis we will use different methods to evaluate how different ML methods will be useful in predicting the outcome variable.
